## Url Field  Formatter

You have model, you have a field say website that saves url. 

you want to save prepend 'http://' everytime, if the user 

has not entered full url, instead he just entered 'something.com'

you don't want to push user to enter full url.

In that case this gem can be helpful. It just prepends 'http://' to the url

if the url does not starts with http or https
